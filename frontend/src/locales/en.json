    "payoutFormulaExplanation": "The payout formula is designed to guarantee that rewards will be distributed over an assumed distribution time.\n\nThe multiplier is evenly increasing throughout a day at a speed of 100% per day.\n\nEvery claim lowers the multiplier based on the amount of partner tokens claimed and the desired distribution time.\n\nThat means the multiplier can go below x1 resulting in claiming fewer partner tokens than the claimed SKILL tokens would be worth.\n\nE.g. The supply of partner tokens is 100 tokens. The distribution time is 10 days.\nIn this scenario each partner token (1) claimed will lower the multiplier by 1 / (100 / 10) = 0.1 = 10%\n\nYou can adjust the amount of unclaimed SKILL to use as well as slippage.\n\nSlippage will protect the multiplier applied to your claim.  If a claim before yours lowers the multiplier too much, your transaction will fail instead of claiming."
