The supply of partner tokens is 100 tokens. The distribution time is 10 days.\nIn this scenario each partner token (1) claimed will lower the multiplier by 1 / (100 / 10) = 0.1 = 10%\n\nYou can adjust the amount of unclaimed SKILL to use as well as slippage.\n\nSlippage will protect the multiplier applied to your claim.  If a claim before yours lowers the multiplier too much, your transaction will fail instead of claiming."
